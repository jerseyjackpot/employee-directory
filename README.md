## Overview

An employee directory built with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

* Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)
