# React Employee Directory

## Overview

An employee directory built with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
